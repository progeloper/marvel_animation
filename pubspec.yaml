  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

    - assets/icons/captain-america-shield.svg

    - assets/images/cap-body.png
    - assets/images/poster1.jpg
    - assets/images/poster2.jpg
    - assets/images/poster3.jpg
    - assets/images/poster4.jpg
    - assets/images/poster5.jpg
    - assets/images/pic1.jpg
    - assets/images/pic2.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Marvel
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Marvel-Regular.ttf
    - family: NotoSansJP
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansJP-Regular.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
